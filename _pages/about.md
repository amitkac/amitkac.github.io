I am currently working as a Senior Applied Scientist at **AWS Agentic AI science team**, where we are developing `Generative AI (GenAI)` and `Large Language Model (LLM)` solutions and tools for code transformation. I have hands-on experience in LLM Agent systems - Post-training with RL for code transformation, building orchestrators, tools, and developing guardrails to ensure the responsible and effective use of powerful LLM agents.

My expertise spans a diverse range of technical domains including `machine learning`, `deep learning`, `advanced signal processing`, `wireless communication`, `computer vision`, `time-series analysis`, and `radar/WiFi sensing technologies`. I have developed and deployed AI/ML solutions across multiple industries - from healthcare applications and IoT device localization to code generation and wireless sensing systems.

Prior to joining Amazon, I worked for approximately 6 years in multicultural and multi-ethnic workplaces across Asia, Europe, and America, gaining valuable experience in working at diverse environments.
