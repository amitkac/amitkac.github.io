I am currently working as a Senior Applied Scientist at **AWS Agentic AI science team**, where we are developing Generative AI (GenAI) and Large Language Model (LLM) solutions and tools for code transformation. Hands-on experience in LLM Agent systems - building orchestrator, tools and developing guardrails to ensure the responsible and effective use of powerful LLM agents.

Apart from that, I have experience in developing, implementing, and fine-tuning AI/ML algorithms in different domains ranging from signal processing, wireless communication, healthcare applications to code generation. Prior to joining Amazon, I worked for approximately 6 years in multicultural and multi-ethnic workplaces across Asia, Europe, and America.
