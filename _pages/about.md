I am a Senior Applied Scientist on the **AWS Agentic AI Science team**, where I work on developing advanced **Generative AI (GenAI)** and **Large Language Model (LLM)**–driven systems for code transformation. My work spans LLM agent architectures, including reinforcement‑learning–based post‑training for code transformation, orchestrator and tool design, and building robust guardrails that enable responsible and reliable use of powerful LLM agents.

My technical background covers a broad spectrum of domains: *machine learning, deep learning, advanced signal processing, wireless communication, computer vision, time‑series modeling, and radar/WiFi sensing*. I have designed and deployed AI/ML solutions across multiple industries—ranging from **healthcare, IoT localization, wireless sensing systems to code generation.**

Before joining Amazon, I spent nearly six years working in multicultural, multi‑ethnic environments across Asia, Europe, and North America, gaining valuable experience collaborating in diverse global settings.
